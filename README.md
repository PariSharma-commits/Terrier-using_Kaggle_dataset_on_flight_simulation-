# Terrier-using_Kaggle_dataset_on_flight_simulation-

The code for the model being implemented for flight simulation is https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t-hTGKUMyv503rVwItt4PHRSa3Z5R0wT?usp=sharing 
It uses the dataset , i.e. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasetengineer/surveildrone-net23 

More data needs to be used and the model needs to be fine-tuned to suit the Indian defence model.
